# Diego Mayorga Data Analyst Portfolio

This Repository holds all of the code, visualizations and queries from my Portfolio Projects. The projects and descriptions are as follows:

## 1. Stock Market Data Visualization
In this project, I extracted and analyzed stock market data using yfinance, pandas, and BeautifulSoup. I then created interactive visualizations with Plotly to explore trends and insights. The final result provides a clear and dynamic view of stock performance over time.

## 2. Dashboard Data Analyst Technologies
This project analyzes survey data from programmers and data analysts to identify the most commonly used programming languages, database technologies, platforms, and web frameworks in the industry. It also explores which technologies professionals are most interested in learning in the future. The findings are presented in a dashboard, available as a PDF.
