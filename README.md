# Diego Mayorga Data Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains the code, visualizations, and queries from my portfolio projects. Below, you'll find a list of projects along with their descriptions:

## British Airways Data Science Job Simulation - [Click here to see the project.](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/British%20Airways%20Customer%20Analysis.ipynb)
●	Utilized **Python** to perform sentiment analysis on 4,000 reviews of British Airways.

●	Implemented **Regex** techniques to clean the data, and text analysis to successfully identified the major complaints for the airline.

●	Applied **regression** and **machine learning** to produce a final model with an accuracy of 80% to predict whether a customer will make a booking with the airline or not.

## Global Electronics Retailer Analysis - [Click here to see the project.](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Global%20Electronics%20Retailer%20Analysis.sql)
● Imported and standardized sales, customer, product, and exchange rate data, ensuring consistency in date formats, currency values, and missing data handling.

● Measured average purchase frequency, identified long-term inactive customers (churn analysis), and segmented customers based on age groups.

● Examined total sales trends over time (daily, monthly, yearly), identified peak sales periods, and analyzed regional revenue differences.

● Utilized advanced **SQL** queries, including **JOINs**, **CTEs**, **DATEDIFF()**, and aggregate functions to extract key business insights efficiently.

## HR Analitycs Dashboard - [Click here to see the project.](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/HR%20Analytics%20Dashboard.pdf)
● This HR Analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of workforce size and attrition, segmented by education, age, salary, and job role. The underlying data model consists of four tables: three dimension tables detailing departments, education, and job roles, and one fact table containing the core HR data.
  
● Cleaned the data, standardized it, and created aggregated columns using **DAX** and **Power Query** in **Power BI**.
  
● Created an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights, shared as a PDF file.

## Food Marketing Analysis - [Click here to see the project.](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Food%20marketing%20analysis.ipynb)
● Conducted in-depth exploratory analysis using **Python** (**Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**) to uncover underlying trends and cause-effect relationships among respondents.

● Provided written insights alongside each visualization to explain discoveries and support strategic recommendations in the food marketing domain.

● Categorized customers based on key attributes such as marital status, purchase channels (in-store, web, catalog), age, education level, and parental status to reveal distinct behavioral segments.

## Movie Genre Data Analysis - [Click here to see the project.](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/movie%20genre%20data%20analysis.ipynb)
● Conducted an exploratory analysis on a comprehensive movie dataset using **Python** (**Pandas**, **Seaborn**) to uncover genre trends.

● Analyzed average budget, revenue, profit, and popularity across genres to determine financial and audience impact.

● Examined key hypotheses, such as whether top-rated and popular movies yield higher profits and revenues, and if highly budgeted films enjoy greater popularity

● Explored profit trends per genre over the years to reveal temporal patterns and performance dynamics.

## US Household Income - [Click here to see the project.](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/us%20household%20income%20project%20-%20data%20cleaning.sql)
● Performed comprehensive data cleaning in **MySQL** by removing duplicate records, standardizing inconsistent data, and handling null values to ensure a reliable dataset.

● Merged multiple tables using **SQL JOINs** to create an integrated dataset for in-depth exploratory analysis.

● Analyzed salary distributions by reviewing the top 5, median, and bottom 5 salaries segmented by state, city, and job type. [Click here to see the SQL code](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/us%20household%20income%20project%20-%20exploratory%20data%20analysis.sql)

● Developed targeted SQL queries to extract actionable insights and uncover regional trends in salary data.

## World Life Expectancy Data - [Click here to see the project.](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/world_life_expectancy-data%20cleaning.sql)
● Executed data cleaning in **MySQL** by removing duplicates, standardizing data entries, and addressing blank values to ensure a reliable dataset.

● Conducted exploratory analysis on world life expectancy data to uncover key trends and variations [Click here to see the SQL code](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/world_life_expectancy-exploratory%20data%20analysis.sql)

● Computed average life expectancy metrics by year and by country to provide a global perspective.

● Investigated the correlation between life expectancy and GDP to explore economic impacts on longevity.

● Compared BMI against life expectancy to analyze the relationship between public health and lifespan.

## Stock Market Data Visualization - [Click here to see the project.](https://github.com/diegoam84/Diego-Mayorga-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Stock%20Market%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)
●	Used **Python** and **BeautifulSoup** to web scrape and extract revenue data of different publicly traded companies.

●	Retrieved and analyzed 15+ years of historical stock price data using **yfinance**.

●	Processed and cleaned 10,000+ data points with pandas to ensure accuracy and consistency.

●	Developed interactive visualizations with Plotly to track stock performance vs historical revenue, providing a clear view of market fluctuations.
