# Diego Mayorga Data Analyst Portfolio

This Repository holds all of the code, visualizations and queries from my Portfolio Projects. The projects and descriptions are as follows:

## 1. Stock Market Data Visualization
In this project, I extracted and analyzed stock market data using yfinance, pandas, and BeautifulSoup. I then created interactive visualizations with Plotly to explore trends and insights. The final result provides a clear and dynamic view of stock performance over time.

## 2. Dashboard Data Analyst Technologies
●	Used Python and BeautifulSoup to web scrape and extract revenue data of different publicly traded companies.
●	Retrieved and analyzed 15+ years of historical stock price data using yfinance.
●	Processed and cleaned 10,000+ data points with pandas to ensure accuracy and consistency.
●	Developed interactive visualizations with Plotly to track stock performance vs historical revenue, providing a clear view of market fluctuations.
