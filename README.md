# Diego Mayorga Data Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains the code, visualizations, and queries from my portfolio projects. Below, you'll find a list of projects along with their descriptions:

## 1. Stock Market Data Visualization
●	Used Python and BeautifulSoup to web scrape and extract revenue data of different publicly traded companies.

●	Retrieved and analyzed 15+ years of historical stock price data using yfinance.

●	Processed and cleaned 10,000+ data points with pandas to ensure accuracy and consistency.

●	Developed interactive visualizations with Plotly to track stock performance vs historical revenue, providing a clear view of market fluctuations.

## 2. HR Analitycs Dashboard
● This HR Analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of workforce size and attrition, segmented by education, age, salary, and job role. The underlying data model consists of four tables: three dimension tables detailing departments, education, and job roles, and one fact table containing the core HR data.

● Cleaned the data, standardized it, and created agregated columns using DAX and Power Query in Power BI.

● Created an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights, shared as a PDF file.
